The objective of this repository is to download data from the WWIII model (hindcast + current simulations), for three wave variables and for a specific geographic location. After downloading and post-processing the Grib2 files, the data will be saved in CSV format.

The scripts also webscrapping the ASCII data from another information source for more current periods (2 months behind the current date).
